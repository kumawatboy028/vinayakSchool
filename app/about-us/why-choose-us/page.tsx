            <strong>Vinayak International Public School</strong> emphasizes the
            importance of {`'Learning by Doing'`}. We believe learning should be
            interesting and practical. Almost every subject has Kits â€“ Maths,
            Science, Environmental Science etc. We intend to draw out and
            nurture their natural abilities, be it artistic, scientific or
            linguistic. A strong emphasis on holistic growth is emphasized with
            subjects like Public Speaking, Creative Writing, Theatre, Music,
            Dance and numerous internal and external competitions we provide.
          </p>
          <p>
            We look after an appropriate Teacher-Student Ratio, constant
            progress tracking of every child and tend to interject in the
            students, strong characteristic values.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are the kind of an institution that believes in empowering our
            students and teachers while moving forward along with technology, be
            it through interactive smart classes or innovative labs.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also emphasize a great deal on Safety and Security. In a true
            International sense, parents can track the performance of their
            wards through various means such as Online Management Software, SMS
            alerts, Call Centre facility and periodic visits by teachers.

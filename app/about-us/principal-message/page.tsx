              <p>
                The world is moving at a very fast pace and each and everyone
                has to keep up with the pace and adapt to change to the best of
                their abilities. Millennials, children of this age have moved
                from the Virtual world to Artificial Intelligence. They are
                bridging the gap between the Age of Knowledge and the Age of
                Information. Online classes are one of the greatest tools in the
                modern era of teaching.
              </p>
              <p>
                Activities are a significant part of the school curriculum and
                they are integrated into the School Curriculum and are done
                within the regular school time. This brings about a balance in
                both academics and activities. Students are given the option and
                the opportunity to participate in an activity of their choice
                for a term. Once they get a certificate of proficiency they move
                to some other activity where they can hone their skills further.

              Today Schools are teaching students the skills to be able to
              accept change. The future is in the hands of those who can adapt
              to change. Research today states that in the future some
              professions from the past will become obsolete and there will be
              professions in the future that we have not thought or imagined of.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thus Education Today is transforming and moving ahead and the
              challenges are manifold. Schools in the present are not about rote
              learning and compartmentalized subjects and assessment of
              retention but all about collaboration, and skill development.
              Knowledge is good, as long as one has the skill to use it for the
              benefit of mankind. We use their interactive and
              experiential-based learning publications in all grades. Teachers
              are selected on the basis of their expertise, experience, and
              ability to use the Interactive Smart Classes with Whiteboard and
              Online Classes. Apart from this regular training is conducted to
              ensure that the students get the best. The Lesson Plans are
              designed to help the teachers understand and educate the students
              with the Six Learning Results of the {`School's`} Vision and
              Mission. Apart from the regular Learning outcomes and the
              differentiated teaching that goes on in the class. Vinayak
              International School is unique because of the above aspect of
              collaboration which is one of the major characteristics of the
              education of the future.
